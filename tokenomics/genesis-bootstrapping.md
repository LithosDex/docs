# Genesis Bootstrapping

Lithos is distributing **5% of the total LITH supply** through Genesis Bootstrapping. The program runs in two stages and is designed to:

1. Seed deep liquidity in early pools.
2. Enable fair price discovery for LITH.
3. Distribute veLITH widely for decentralized governance.

**Important:**

* No funds have been raised for this launch.
* The distribution is fully community-based.

***

### Stage 1 – Stable & XPL Pools

* **Dates:** Oct 1 – Dec 1, 2025
* **Pools:** XPL/USDT, USDe/USDT
* Duration: 2 months
* Withdraw anytime (rewards adjust based on time in pool).

Stage 1 focuses on building TVL, generating early fees, and aligning Lithos with Plasma’s ecosystem.

***

### Stage 2 – LITH Liquidity

* **Dates:** Oct 11, 2025 – Jan 11, 2026
* **Pool:** LITH/XPL
* Duration: 3 months
* **TGE:** Oct 11, 2025 at 16:00 CET

Bootstrapping runs beyond TGE, with the LITH pool giving the strongest upside for those who stay deposited.
