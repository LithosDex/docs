# Initial Supply and Emissions Schedule

## Initial Supply

_Initial supply distribution chart will be added upon finalization of token distribution details._

### **Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)**

A significant portion of the initial supply is dedicated to Protocol-Owned Liquidity to seed core trading pairs on Plasma. This ensures deep liquidity from launch for essential pairs including XPL/USDT, USDAI/USDT, and USDAI/sUSDAI, reducing dependency on mercenary capital and providing a stable foundation for the ecosystem.

### **Public Goods Fund**

A substantial allocation is permanently locked into the Public Goods Fund to support long-term ecosystem development, grants for projects building on Plasma, and community initiatives that benefit the broader ecosystem.

### **Foundation**

Foundation allocation includes operational funding and strategic reserves, with a significant portion locked in veLITH to align foundation interests with long-term protocol success and provide sustainable revenue through governance participation.

### **Ignition Program**

Dedicated allocation for the Ignition Program, which uses protocol revenue to purchase LITH tokens on the open market and distribute them to veLITH holders. This creates deflationary pressure while rewarding committed governance participants.

### **Community Growth**

Allocation for community incentives, ecosystem partnerships, and growth initiatives to expand Lithos adoption across the Plasma ecosystem.

### **Initial Liquidity Incentives**

Small allocation for initial liquidity incentives to bootstrap trading activity before full emissions begin, ensuring smooth protocol launch and user onboarding.

## **Emissions**

### **Phased Launch Strategy**

Unlike traditional DEX launches, Lithos employs a unique phased approach:

**Phase 1: Protocol-Owned Liquidity Period**

* **No token emissions initially**
* POL provides base liquidity for core trading pairs
* Foundation veLITH positions generate revenue for Ignition Program
* Establishes trading volume and fee generation

**Phase 2: Community Governance Activation**

* LITH emissions begin based on community governance decision
* veLITH holders direct emission rewards to liquidity pools
* Full ve(3,3) mechanics activated

### **ve(3,3) Dynamics**

Once emissions begin, all stakeholders are aligned through ve(3,3) dynamics:

* **veLITH holders**: vote for highest volume pools to maximize fee generation or pools with partner bribes, creating positive feedback loops for successful tokens
* **Liquidity Providers (LPs):** receive emissions driven by "Real Yield" metrics and community-directed incentives
* **Traders**: benefit from deep liquidity and low slippage across stable and volatile pools
* **Ecosystem Partners**: access capital-efficient trading and can incentivize liquidity through the Bribe-Match Program

### **Emissions Specifications**

_Emissions parameters will be determined by community governance when the emission phase begins. Initial parameters will be proposed based on:_

* **Weekly emissions**: To be determined by governance
* **Weekly emissions decay**: Community-controlled parameter
  * _Emissions for liquidity providers_: Majority allocation
  * _Weekly veLITH rebase_: Anti-dilution protection for lockers
  * _Protocol development allocation_: Minimal percentage for ongoing development
* **Maximum supply**: To be determined through governance process

### **Sustainable Tokenomics**

Lithos prioritizes long-term sustainability over short-term incentives:

* **Large permanent locks**: Significant supply permanently committed to long-term programs
* **Revenue-driven value**: Ignition Program creates buying pressure using real protocol revenue
* **Community control**: Governance determines emission schedules and parameters
* **Aligned incentives**: All participants benefit from protocol success and trading volume growth

_Detailed emission schedules and distribution parameters will be published following community governance decisions and protocol launch preparations._
