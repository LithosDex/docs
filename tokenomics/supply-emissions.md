<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/2025.09.28 i-n-s-p-l_v0.2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Total Initial Supply: 50,000,000 LITH**

### **Initial LP (2% - 1,000,000 LITH)**

Initial liquidity provision to seed core trading pairs on Plasma at launch. This minimal allocation ensures basic market functionality while the protocol transitions to its POL-driven model.

### **Liquidity Incentives (5% - 2,500,000 LITH)**

Dedicated allocation for ongoing liquidity incentives, including the Bribe-Match Program where the protocol matches external bribes to amplify incentives for strategic liquidity pools.

### **MM + CEX (5% - 2,500,000 LITH)**

Market maker partnerships and centralized exchange listings to ensure proper price discovery, reduce volatility, and provide additional liquidity venues for LITH trading.

### **Ecosystem Growth Fund (10% - 5,000,000 LITH)**

Ecosystem growth fund is used primarly for marketing partners, liquidity incentives for larger liquid funds and ve groups.

### **Airdrop (5% - 2,500,000 LITH)**

Locked allocation for community airdrops to reward early supporters, Plasma ecosystem participants, and strategic community building initiatives.

### **Public Goods Fund (40% - 20,000,000 LITH)**

The largest allocation, permanently locked to support long-term ecosystem development, grants for projects building on Plasma, research initiatives, and community programs that benefit the broader ecosystem.

### **Foundation (19% - 9,500,000 LITH)**

Foundation allocation for operational funding and strategic reserves. A significant portion will be locked in veLITH to align foundation interests with long-term protocol success and generate sustainable revenue through governance participation.

### **Team (14% - 7,000,000 LITH)**

Team allocation with 1-year cliff and 2-year vesting schedule to ensure long-term commitment and alignment with protocol success. Covers core team compensation and retention incentives.

All tranches of locked tokens will be transparently verifiable post-launch.

## **Emissions**

### **Phased Launch Strategy**

Unlike traditional DEX launches, Lithos employs a unique phased approach:

**Phase 1: Protocol-Owned Liquidity Period**

* **No token emissions initially**
* POL provides base liquidity for core trading pairs
* Foundation veLITH positions generate revenue for Ignition Program
* Establishes trading volume and fee generation

**Phase 2: Community Governance Activation**

* LITH emissions begin based on community governance decision
* veLITH holders direct emission rewards to liquidity pools
* Full ve(3,3) mechanics activated

### **ve(3,3) Dynamics**

Once emissions begin, all stakeholders are aligned through ve(3,3) dynamics:

* **veLITH holders** — vote for highest volume pools to maximize fee generation or pools with partner bribes, creating positive feedback loops for successful tokens
* **Liquidity Providers (LPs)** — receive emissions driven by "Real Yield" metrics and community-directed incentives
* **Traders** — benefit from deep liquidity and low slippage across stable and volatile pools
* **Ecosystem Partners** — access capital-efficient trading and can incentivize liquidity through the Bribe-Match Program

### **Emissions Specifications**

_Emissions parameters will be determined by community governance when the emission phase begins. Initial parameters will be proposed based on:_

* **Weekly emissions**: To be determined by governance
* **Weekly emissions decay**: Community-controlled parameter
  * _Emissions for liquidity providers_: Majority allocation
  * _Weekly veLITH rebase_: Anti-dilution protection for lockers
  * _Protocol development allocation_: Minimal percentage for ongoing development
* **Maximum supply**: To be determined through governance process

### **Sustainable Tokenomics**

Lithos prioritizes long-term sustainability over short-term incentives:

* **Large permanent locks**: Significant supply permanently committed to long-term programs
* **Revenue-driven value**: Ignition Program creates buying pressure using real protocol revenue
* **Community control**: Governance determines emission schedules and parameters
* **Aligned incentives**: All participants benefit from protocol success and trading volume growth
