# Initial Supply and Emissions Schedule

### Initial Supply

The initial supply of LITH is designed to provide liquidity depth from launch, fund long-term ecosystem growth, and ensure alignment between the foundation, community, and governance participants. A detailed supply distribution chart will be published once final allocations are confirmed.

**Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)**

* A significant portion of the initial supply is allocated to Protocol-Owned Liquidity.
* POL seeds core trading pairs such as XPL/USDT, USDAI/USDT, and USDAI/sUSDAI.
* Permanent liquidity reduces dependence on mercenary capital and stabilizes trading conditions from day one.

**Public Goods Fund**

* A permanent allocation supports ecosystem development, grants, and community initiatives.
* Funds are reserved for projects building on Plasma and for activities that deliver long-term value to the broader ecosystem.

**Foundation**

* The foundation allocation covers operational funding and strategic reserves.
* A meaningful portion is locked into veLITH, ensuring that the foundation participates in governance and earns protocol revenue alongside the community.
* This structure aligns foundation incentives with long-term protocol success.

**Ignition Program**

* A dedicated allocation supports the Ignition Program.
* Revenue from trading activity is used to purchase LITH from the open market.
* Tokens acquired through buybacks are redistributed to veLITH holders, creating consistent demand and reinforcing deflationary pressure.

**Community Growth**

* Reserved supply for incentives, partnerships, and initiatives that drive adoption of Lithos across the Plasma ecosystem.
* Growth-focused allocation ensures continued expansion and user onboarding.

**Initial Liquidity Incentives**

* A small allocation is used for liquidity incentives during the earliest stages of the launch.
* These incentives bootstrap initial trading activity and smooth the transition into the full emission phase.

### Emissions

Lithos adopts a phased emission strategy that emphasizes sustainability and community governance rather than short-term liquidity mining.

**Phased Launch Strategy**

* **Phase 1: Protocol-Owned Liquidity Period**
  * No emissions are distributed initially.
  * POL supplies liquidity for essential trading pairs.
  * Foundation veLITH positions begin generating revenue for the Ignition Program.
  * The focus is on establishing trading volume and organic fee generation.
* **Phase 2: Community Governance Activation**
  * LITH emissions commence once governance decides conditions are met.
  * veLITH holders direct emissions toward liquidity pools through weekly gauge voting.
  * Full ve(3,3) dynamics are activated, ensuring that incentives align across all stakeholders.

**ve(3,3) Dynamics**

* **veLITH Holders** vote for pools that generate the strongest volume or partner bribes, creating self-reinforcing liquidity loops.
* **Liquidity Providers** receive emissions tied to real yield and community-driven incentives, ensuring rewards are linked to productive liquidity.
* **Traders** benefit from deep liquidity and competitive pricing across both stable and volatile pools.
* **Ecosystem Partners** can direct liquidity through the Bribe-Match Program, accessing capital-efficient trading while strengthening their token markets.

**Emissions Specifications**

* Emission parameters will be decided by community governance.
* Initial proposals will include:
  * Weekly emissions levels
  * Emission decay rate (governance-controlled)
  * Majority allocation for liquidity providers
  * Weekly veLITH rebase to prevent dilution
  * A minimal allocation for protocol development
  * Maximum supply parameters determined through governance

**Sustainable Tokenomics**

* Large permanent locks dedicate a substantial portion of supply to long-term programs.
* Revenue-backed buybacks through the Ignition Program create natural buying pressure.
* Governance decides emission schedules, ensuring emissions evolve with ecosystem needs.
* Incentives are aligned so that liquidity providers, traders, veLITH holders, and partners all benefit from ecosystem growth.

A detailed emission schedule and finalized distribution breakdown will be published after governance decisions and final launch preparations.
