# Ignition Program

Ignition is the protocol's recurring buyback-and-distribute initiative that rewards long-term lockers with revenue-backed LITH. The program operates on a four-week cadence and complements weekly emissions by adding a second incentive stream for veLITH holders.

## Cycle & Qualification

* **Cadence:** Each Ignition cycle runs for four weeks.
* **Eligibility:** Users must create a new veLITH lock worth at least `10,000` LITH during the active cycle. Existing positions do not qualify unless they meet the minimum via a new lock.

## Tier Structure

Participants are placed into tiers based on the size of their qualifying lock. Each tier carries a multiplier that determines how much weight the lock receives in the end-of-cycle distribution.

| Tier | Lock Size (veLITH) | Multiplier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spark | 10,000–24,999 | 1.0× |
| Thruster | 25,000–49,999 | 1.5× |
| Launch | 50,000+ | 2.0× |

## Boost Modifiers

Multipliers can be enhanced through launch partnerships, liquidity support, or by acting early in the cycle.

* **Launch Partner:** +5% added to the tier multiplier.
* **Protocol with LP support:** +2.5% added to the tier multiplier for teams that supply liquidity.
* **First-week participation:** +10% added to the tier multiplier when the qualifying lock is created in the first week of the cycle.

Boosts stack multiplicatively with the base tier multiplier. For example, a Launch tier lock (2.0×) made in week one by a Launch Partner with LP support receives `2.0 × 1.05 × 1.025 × 1.10 ≈ 2.36×` weighting.

## Distribution & Rewards

At the end of the four-week cycle, all qualifying locks are aggregated, weighted by their final multiplier, and used to apportion the Ignition bonus pool. Participants receive a proportional share of the pool based on their percentage of the total weighted veLITH. Holding 5% of the weighted total results in 5% of the Ignition bonus.

Ignition is fueled by LITH buybacks sourced from converted bribes and fees. This design boosts rewards for committed lockers while simultaneously creating sustained buy pressure for LITH on the market.

To promote fairness and prevent any single participant from taking an outsized share, no individual lock may claim more than 15% of the bonus allocated to its class.

## Foundation Share

A portion of the LITH purchased through Ignition may be retained by the Foundation to bolster its veLITH voting power. This reserve ensures the Foundation remains aligned with long-term governance and liquidity objectives while the majority of rewards continue flowing to community lockers.
