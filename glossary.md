**AMM (Automated Market Maker)**\
A type of decentralized exchange mechanism where trades are executed against liquidity pools rather than order books.

**Bribe (Voting Incentive)**\
Tokens deposited by a protocol or user into a gauge to encourage veLITH holders to vote for that pool.

**Bribe-Match Program**\
A Lithos initiative where incentives deposited by qualified partners are matched by the protocol, effectively doubling their impact.

**Epoch**\
A 7-day cycle in Lithos (Thursday to Thursday, reset at 00:00 UTC) during which votes, emissions, and incentives are set. Rewards are claimable at the end of each Epoch.

**Gauge**\
A smart contract that distributes LITH emissions to a liquidity pool. veLITH holders vote to decide which gauges receive emissions each Epoch.

**Ignition Program**\
A buyback mechanism that uses protocol revenue to purchase LITH from the open market and redistribute it to veLITH holders.

**Liquidity Pool (LP)**\
A pair of tokens locked in a smart contract that facilitates swaps. LPs earn trading fees and can stake LP tokens in gauges to earn emissions.

**Liquidity Provider (LP)**\
A user who deposits tokens into a pool to provide liquidity for trading. In return, LPs earn fees and emissions.

**LITH**\
The native utility token of Lithos. It is used for liquidity incentives, emissions, and governance when locked as veLITH.

**veLITH**\
The vote-escrowed form of LITH, issued as an NFT when LITH is locked for up to 4 years. veLITH gives governance rights and access to protocol rewards.

**POL (Protocol-Owned Liquidity)**\
Liquidity seeded and owned by Lithos. POL ensures deep liquidity in core pairs and reduces reliance on mercenary capital.

**Rebase (Anti-Dilution Rebase)**\
A weekly mechanism where 30% of emissions are distributed to veLITH holders as locked LITH, preventing dilution of long-term lockers.

**Slippage**\
The difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which it executes, often due to liquidity depth.

**Stable Pool**\
A liquidity pool designed for correlated assets (e.g., USDT/USDC) with minimal fees and very low slippage.

**Volatile Pool**\
A liquidity pool for uncorrelated assets (e.g., LITH/XPL), optimized for price discovery with standard fee levels.

**Vote-Escrow (ve)**\
A model where tokens are locked for a period of time to receive governance power. Longer locks = more voting weight.

**Whitelisting**\
The approval process required for new tokens before they can be traded, added to pools, or included in gauges.
