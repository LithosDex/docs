Swapping on Lithos works like any other AMM, but runs on Plasma for faster and cheaper transactions.

### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Connect Wallet**

* Open the Lithos app and connect a supported wallet.
* Ensure your wallet is connected to the **Plasma network**.

**2. Select Tokens**

* Choose the token you want to swap from the “From” field.
* Choose the token you want to receive in the “To” field.
* If you cannot find your token, make sure it is whitelisted (see **Token Whitelisting**).

**3. Enter Amount**

* Type the amount of the token you want to swap.
* The interface will automatically calculate how much of the other token you will receive, including fees.

**4. Review Pricing**

* Check the exchange rate, slippage tolerance, and fees.
* Lithos routes trades through the most efficient pools, ensuring you get the best available price.

**5. Confirm Swap**

* Click **Swap** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
* Once confirmed on-chain, your new tokens will appear in your wallet balance.

#### Things to Know

* **Stable pools** are best for pairs like USDT/USDC, where prices don’t move much.
* **Volatile pools** are for pairs like LITH/XPL, where price discovery happens.
* **Fees** depend on the pool type. Stable pairs usually have lower fees, volatile pairs higher.
* **USDT swaps** don’t require gas on Plasma.
