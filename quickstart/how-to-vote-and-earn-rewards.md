Voting with veLITH determines how LITH emissions are allocated. Voters also earn a mix of fees, incentives, and anti-dilution rebases.

### Step-by-Step

**1. Open Gauges**\
Go to the **Gauges** page in the app.

**2. Select Pools**\
Pick one or more liquidity pools to vote for. You can split your voting power across multiple pools.

**3. Cast Vote**\
Submit and confirm your vote. Votes apply for the current Epoch only.

**4. Earn Rewards**\
At the end of the Epoch, veLITH voters can claim:

* A share of trading fees from the pools they voted on.
* Voting incentives (bribes) deposited by partner protocols.
* A weekly rebase of emissions to protect against dilution.

**5. Claim Rewards**\
Go to the **Rewards** tab after each Epoch and claim accumulated rewards.
