# How to Lock LITH into veLITH

Locking LITH creates veLITH, which grants voting power and access to governance rewards.

### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Go to Governance**\
Navigate to the **Governance** section in the Lithos app.

**2. Choose Lock Amount and Duration**\
Enter the amount of LITH you want to lock and select a duration (up to 4 years).

* Longer locks = more veLITH voting power.
* veLITH balance decays linearly until expiry, encouraging continuous relocking.

**3. Confirm Transaction**\
Approve the transaction in your wallet. veLITH will be minted as an NFT and sent to your wallet.

**4. Manage veLITH**\
veLITH positions are flexible:

* Increase lock amount.
* Extend lock duration.
* Merge or split positions.
* Sell veLITH on the secondary market.

**5. Start Voting**\
Use veLITH to participate in gauge voting and earn rewards from fees, emissions, and incentives.
