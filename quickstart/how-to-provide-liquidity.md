**1. Connect Wallet**\
Open the Lithos app and connect your wallet. Ensure your network is set to Plasma.

**2. Select a Pool**\
Navigate to the **Pools** section. Pools are categorized by type:

* **Stable Pools**: For correlated assets like USDT/USDC. Low slippage and low fees.
* **Volatile Pools**: For uncorrelated pairs like LITH/XPL. Designed for price discovery, with standard fees.

**3. Add Tokens**\
Choose the pool and input the amount of tokens to deposit. The app will automatically calculate the required ratio.

* Example: Adding USDT/USDC to a stable pool requires equal values of both tokens.
* Example: Adding LITH/XPL to a volatile pool requires both tokens in the current pool ratio.

**4. Approve & Confirm**\
Approve the tokens in your wallet and confirm the liquidity transaction. Youâ€™ll receive LP tokens representing your share of the pool.

**5. Stake in a Gauge (Optional)**\
If the pool has a gauge, you can stake LP tokens directly into it. Staking enables you to earn:

* LITH emissions based on veLITH voting.
* Voting incentives (bribes) deposited by partners.

**6. Track Rewards**\
Go to the **Portfolio** or **Rewards** tab to see accrued fees, emissions, and incentives.
