Epochs are the weekly cycle that governs voting, incentives, and emissions in Lithos.\


**Duration**

* Each Epoch lasts 7 days, from Thursday to Thursday.
* Resets occur at 00:00 UTC (Wednesday–Thursday night).

**Voting**

* Votes must be cast every Epoch.
* Vote weights reset automatically at the start of a new cycle.
* The “Revote” option lets you repeat your previous votes with one click.

**Incentives**

* Voting incentives (bribes) can be deposited at any time during the Epoch.
* Incentives must be in place before the reset to count for the upcoming cycle.
* veLITH holders only earn from pools they actively voted for.

**Rewards**

* Rewards are distributed once the Epoch ends.
* Fees and incentives become claimable as a lump sum.
* The anti-dilution rebase (30% of emissions) is applied to all veLITH holders.

**Emissions**

* LITH emissions are recalculated each Epoch based on votes.
* Pools with more votes and incentives receive larger allocations.
