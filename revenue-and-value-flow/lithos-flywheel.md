# Lithos Flywheel

Lithos is built around a feedback system where trading activity generates revenue that cycles back to participants. Fees, emissions, and incentives are tied together so that liquidity, governance, and demand for LITH reinforce one another.

### Revenue Sources

**Trading Fees**

* Every swap generates a fee.
* Fees are distributed between liquidity providers, veLITH holders, and the protocol treasury.

**Voting Incentives (Bribes)**

* Protocols deposit incentives into gauges to attract veLITH votes.
* veLITH holders claim these incentives after each Epoch.

**Ignition Program**

* A portion of protocol revenue is used to buy LITH on the open market.
* Purchased tokens are redistributed to veLITH holders, adding a revenue-backed reward layer.

**veNFT Holdings**

* The foundation maintains veLITH positions, earning revenue and participating in governance.

### Flow of Value

1. **LITH Emissions → Liquidity Providers**\
   Liquidity providers stake LP tokens in gauges and earn LITH emissions.
2. **Liquidity → Trading Fees**\
   Liquidity improves trading conditions, driving volume and generating swap fees.
3. **Trading Fees → Protocol Revenue**\
   A share of fees flows into the treasury and to veLITH voters.
4. **Revenue → Ignition Program**\
   Revenue is used to buy LITH on the open market, reducing supply.
5. **Buybacks → veLITH Holders**\
   Bought-back LITH is redistributed to lockers, rewarding governance participants.
6. **veLITH Holders → Gauge Voting**\
   veLITH holders vote weekly to direct emissions, closing the loop and keeping incentives aligned with active pools.

### Feedback Loops

* **Liquidity Loop**: Emissions attract LPs → LPs provide liquidity → better trading conditions → more volume → more fees → stronger LP incentives.
* **Governance Loop**: veLITH votes direct emissions → pools attract liquidity and bribes → veLITH voters earn more rewards → locking demand increases.
* **Ignition Loop**: Revenue funds buybacks → bought-back LITH goes to veLITH holders → long-term lockers benefit → demand for governance grows.
