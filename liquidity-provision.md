# Liquidity Provision

### Liquidity Pools

Lithos provides a range of liquidity pool designs tailored to different asset types and trading strategies. The pool architecture combines proven AMM models with dynamic fee structures and a streamlined user interface. Pools are designed to support both stablecoin swaps with minimal slippage and volatile pairs focused on price discovery, giving participants multiple ways to engage with the protocol.

### Lithos Pool Types

**Stable Pools**

* Designed for correlated assets such as USDT/USDC or USDAI/sUSDAI.
* Provide minimal fees and low slippage, making them well-suited for stablecoin trading.

**Volatile Pools**

* Built for uncorrelated assets such as XPL/USDT or LITH/XPL.
* Facilitate efficient price discovery while generating higher trading fees for liquidity providers.

**Multiple Fee Tiers**

* Pools operate with variable fee structures, calibrated to the volatility and trading volume of each pair.
* Supports both low-cost stable swaps and higher-fee volatile trades.

**Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)**

* Lithos seeds permanent base liquidity into essential pairs, reducing reliance on mercenary capital.
* POL ensures consistent liquidity depth and stability for core markets from launch.
