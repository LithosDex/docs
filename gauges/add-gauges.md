# Add Gauges

Anyone can add a gauge for a pool without holding `veLITH`.

Adding a gauge will allow voting incentives to be deposited for the given pool.

### How to add a gauge?

1. Connect Wallet
2. Navigate to "More" -> "Protocols"
3. Select "Add Gauge"
4. Select your pool and confirm

*Note: Pool tokens must be whitelisted before a gauge can be added. See [Whitelist Tokens](whitelist-tokens.md) for the whitelisting process.*
