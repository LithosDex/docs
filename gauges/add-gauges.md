# Add Gauges

### Gauge Creation

Any user can create a gauge for a liquidity pool without the need to hold veLITH. Creating a gauge enables that pool to receive voting incentives from veLITH holders. Once a gauge is active, partners and participants can deposit incentives, and veLITH voters can direct emissions to the pool.

* **Voting Incentives**\
  Gauges allow pools to attract veLITH votes by offering incentives, increasing liquidity depth and visibility.
* **Emissions Access**\
  Once a gauge is created, the pool becomes eligible to receive LITH emissions based on weekly governance votes.
* **Ecosystem Growth**\
  Gauges make it possible for new pools and projects to participate in Lithos’ incentive structure, strengthening overall liquidity.

### How to Add a Gauge

1. Connect your wallet to Lithos.
2. Navigate to **More → Protocols** in the dashboard.
3. Select **Add Gauge**.
4. Choose the pool you want to add a gauge for and confirm the transaction.

### Important Notes

* Pool tokens must be whitelisted before a gauge can be created.
* To request token whitelisting, follow the process described in **Token Whitelisting**.
* Once a gauge is live, partners can begin depositing incentives at any point during an Epoch.
