### Token Whitelisting

All new tokens must be whitelisted before being listed on Lithos. The purpose of the whitelist is to protect users, filter out scams or illegitimate assets, and ensure that only trustworthy projects gain access to Lithos liquidity. By maintaining control over the listing process, the protocol preserves the security and credibility of the broader ecosystem.\


* **User Protection**\
  Prevents malicious contracts and scam tokens from being listed, reducing exposure to potential exploits.
* **Ecosystem Integrity**\
  Ensures that only legitimate projects with sustainable goals participate in liquidity pools.
* **Liquidity Safety**\
  Protects liquidity providers from supplying capital to unaudited or unverified projects.
* **Governance Confidence**\
  Maintains trust in the Lithos governance process by preventing manipulation through fake or low-quality assets.

### How to Request Whitelisting

* **Contact the Team**\
  Projects seeking whitelisting should reach out through official Lithos communication channels such as [Discord](https://discord.gg/lithos) or [X](https://x.com/lithos_to).
* **Provide Documentation**\
  Teams are expected to submit relevant details including token contract address, project information, team background, audits (if available), and intended liquidity pairs.
* **Review Process**\
  The Lithos team will assess each application to ensure that the token meets security, legitimacy, and ecosystem-fit standards.
* **Approval and Listing**\
  Once approved, the token will be added to the whitelist and integrated into the protocol. The project can then create liquidity pools, access veLITH voting through gauges, and participate in ecosystem programs.

### Whitelisting Criteria

* Verified smart contract deployment with transparent code.
* Active and identifiable project team or community governance structure.
* Clear use case and token utility within or beyond the Plasma ecosystem.
* Sufficient liquidity commitment to support healthy trading activity.
* Compliance with ecosystem standards and absence of malicious features.
