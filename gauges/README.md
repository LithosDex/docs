# Gauges & Voting Incentives

### veLITH Gauge Voting

The veLITH gauge voting system creates a dynamic marketplace for liquidity. Incentives flow toward pools that generate the highest trading volumes and fees, ensuring that emissions are allocated where capital is most effectively utilized. This design makes Lithos resilient, adaptive, and capital-efficient.

#### Liquidity Bootstrapping

* Protocols can overcome the cold-start problem by depositing voting incentives.
* Deposits attract veLITH votes, directing emissions to their liquidity pools from the earliest stages.

#### Liquidity Management

* Partner protocols can adjust liquidity levels by changing their weekly incentive deposits.
* Incentive flexibility allows pools to expand or contract in line with project strategies.

#### Self-Optimizing Allocation

* Emissions are continuously directed toward the most productive pools.
* Pools generating strong volume and fee activity naturally receive more incentives, creating an automatic feedback loop.

#### Bribe-Match Program

* Ecosystem partners who qualify receive matched incentives from Lithos.
* Matching effectively doubles the value of partner incentives while sharing responsibility for liquidity growth.
