# Gauges & Voting Incentives

The veLITH gauge voting system establishes a dynamic & self-optimizing marketplace for liquidity. Incentives are directed toward the most productive pools — those generating the highest trading volumes and fees — ensuring that liquidity flows where it is most efficiently utilized. This mechanism makes Lithos a resilient, adaptive and capital-efficient DEX.

* **Bootstrapping Liquidity**: Protocols can solve the initial cold-start of liquidity by depositing voting incentives.
* **Liquidity Management**: Protocols can adjust their liquidity levels by modifying their weekly incentives deposit, enabling them to grow and maintain their pools in line with their strategic objectives
* **Self-Optimizing Liquidity Allocation**: Lithos's ve(3,3) tokenomics structure automatically directs emissions toward pools generating the highest trading volumes and fees.
* **Bribe-Match Program**: Lithos matches ecosystem partner incentives, doubling the effective bribing power while sharing responsibility for liquidity growth.

### Voting Incentives Specifications

* **Voting incentive claim**: `veLITH` holders receive rewards after the following Epoch in the form of a claimable lump sum
* **Epoch duration**: 1 week (Thursday to Thursday)
* **Tokens**: Any whitelisted tokens can be deposited as voting incentive
* **Voting incentive deposits**: Any time during the epoch
* **Bribe matching**: Qualified ecosystem partners receive matching incentives from Lithos

To attract votes from `veLITH` holders, voting incentive must be deposited at least a few hours before the Epoch changes at 00:00 UTC Wednesday-Thursday night.

Earning voting incentives (and trading fees) requires weekly voting.
