# Add Voting Incentives

Anyone can add voting incentives to a pool for which a gauge has been added. The voting incentive must be deposited in tokens that have been whitelisted.

The more voting incentives added for a gauge, the more `$LITH` emissions it is likely to receive in the next epoch.

**Bribe-Match Program**: Qualified ecosystem partners may receive matching incentives from Lithos, effectively doubling their bribing power. Contact the team to learn about qualification criteria.

### How to add voting incentives?

1. Connect Wallet
2. Navigate to "More" -> "Protocols"
3. Select "Add Voting incentives"
4. Select your gauge, the amount of tokens for the Epoch, and confirm

*Note: Voting incentives must be deposited at least a few hours before the Epoch changes at 00:00 UTC Wednesday-Thursday night to be effective for that epoch.*
