### Voting Incentives

Anyone can add voting incentives to a pool once a gauge has been created. Incentives must be deposited in whitelisted tokens to qualify. By offering incentives, projects and participants encourage veLITH holders to direct their votes toward specific pools. The more incentives deposited into a gauge, the more LITH emissions that pool is likely to receive in the following Epoch.\


* **Liquidity Growth**\
  Incentives motivate veLITH holders to vote for targeted pools, directing emissions and attracting liquidity.
* **Capital Efficiency**\
  Pools with higher trading activity and strong incentive support receive greater emissions, reinforcing productive liquidity.
* **Protocol Participation**\
  Any project or participant can use voting incentives to align liquidity depth with their strategic goals.

### Bribe-Match Program

Qualified ecosystem partners may participate in the Bribe-Match Program. Under this system, Lithos matches partner incentives deposited into gauges, effectively doubling the bribing power while sharing responsibility for ecosystem liquidity growth. Projects can contact the team to learn about qualification requirements.

### How to Add Voting Incentives

1. Connect your wallet to Lithos.
2. Navigate to **More → Protocols**.
3. Select **Add Voting Incentives**.
4. Choose the gauge, specify the amount of tokens to deposit for the Epoch, and confirm.
5. Repeat the process every Epoch to maintain voting incentives.

### Important Notes

* Only whitelisted tokens can be deposited as voting incentives.
* Deposits must be made at least a few hours before the Epoch change at 00:00 UTC (Wednesday–Thursday) to count for the upcoming cycle.
* Voting and rewards operate on a weekly cycle, and veLITH holders must vote each Epoch to remain eligible for incentive rewards.
